## Abosammenligner

Many telecommunications companies in Denmark offer discounts or outright free tech products if you commit to being
a customer with them for 6 months. This is unprofitable for the user if they keep the subscription, but in many cases,
there is significant money to be saved by getting the product, paying the subscription for 6 months and then switching to
another provider. 

Abosammenligner is a project that compares the offers that come with different phone- and internet subscription plans in
Denmark, allowing users to save thousands of DKK per year if they are in the market for new tech. 


### Planned features

- A reminder leading up to the 6-month commitment ending, reminding the user that the binding period is ending, letting
them switch to another provider and taking advantage of a new offer

- A calculator showing how much money the user has saved in total

- More to come
